## 1 - Quantum Algorithms 
* **Project Area :** Linear algebra, Logical Thinking
* **Mentors :** Fahad Sheikh (Mando#5308)
* **Description :** I have done a similar project last year, where I have done problems from Quantum Computing Nielson and Chung. Some parts of this project will be the same, but at the end of the project I would like for mentees to present a literature review on a set of topics I will give them. I would mainly focus on Nielson and Chung for understanding the basics, and would like to introduce more algorithms other than Shor’s Algorithm and Grover’s algorithm. The mentees have to present a paper on a topic, so that it can make me sure what have they understood in the project. Having a good grip of python is a requirement, as in the later part of the project we will dive into Qiskit, an open-source python module by IBM.

* **Description :** Students taking this project will get to learn about data analysis and model building through popular statistical tools, the base of which being regression. Initially basics of probability and statistics will be covered after which we move into linear regression, our focus of concern being with multiple analysis. There will be an applied project based on the same and students will be required to build models and interpret the results as a real-life frame. We will move into complex topics like panel-data and time-series regression followed by another applied project. If time permits we can cover non-linear regression too.

## 4 - Number Theory and Applications
* **Mentors :** Priya Gole (Priyaa#6917), Abhishek Shree (killBird#5626)
* **Project Area :** Number Theory and Abstract Algebra
* **Description :** This project aims to introduce the mentees to the basic concepts of number theory and abstract algebra.

  The first part of the project is theoretical, wherein concepts related to number theory and group theory will be introduced, and we would spend our time scratching our heads while trying out problems.

  The other component would be the application of the concepts learned in areas like cryptography, random number generation, hash functions, etc.

## 5 - Geometric Mechanics  
* **Mentors :** Mohammad Saad (Saad#9798), Annadur Rahul Kesavan (luharnavasek#5344)
* **Project Area :** Mathematical Physics 
* **Description :** The reading project aims to serve the classical mechanics in a mathematical fashion, unlike the manner in which it is taught mostly in a semester long course. We would not cover the wider contents of a typical mechanics course (like PHY102 or PHY401), instead focus on the mathematics, specially geometry, of the involved physical framework. For example, it would include how the dynamics of a system takes place on a configuration manifold, the geometries of the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalism, so on and so forth. We would not be solving funky pully-cart or rotation problems. The project would also have an underlying theme of appreciating the history and philosophy of mathematics and physics, by occasionally visiting some interesting anecdotes wherever required. (Basically, I would try to serve the project the way I wish classical mechanics should have been taught to me.)

  For the evaluation, a common ground can be decided once the project commences. As of now, a final combined group report (ofcourse in LaTeX) or a short presentation would suffice for evaluation.

* **Intended Audience :** UG Y20 and Y21 with basic familiarity of classical mechanics. As per the Stamatics theme, the project would be somewhat mathematically involved. If you're motivated enough to read books and learn, do apply. 
* **Expected Duration :** 6 weeks
* **Expected Weekly Commitment :** 2-4 hrs

## 6 - An Invitation to Functional Analysis  
* **Mentors :** Rahul Sethi (the-last-knight#4011)
* **Project Area :** Analysis
* **Description :** The directed reading project serves as an introduction to Functional Analysis. In the first half, we will develop some general techniques in Functional Analysis, and in the latter half, the focus will primarily be on Hilbert Space Theory. If time permits, we may look at selected topics in Operator Theory, including exposure to research-level problems.

    This project will help students develop not only an understanding of Functional Analysis but also inculcate an attitude of mathematical inquiry in general. There will be an emphasis (and no compromise) on mathematical rigor. The pace of the project will be dictated by the mathematical maturity of the group.

    Prerequisites:
(i) MTH301A* (A First Course in Real Analysis) or equivalent. 

    (ii) General Topology (specifically Ch. 2,3 of Munkres' Topology).

   (iii) Introductory Measure Theory (including Riesz Representation Theorem, Radon Measures, etc.)
Additionally, you will be required to prepare a report in LaTeX, and proficiency in the same is a must. 

    (ii) and (iii) are desirable but not necessary. If you are not sure whether you meet the prerequisites for this project, please get in touch with the mentor directly.

    *You may register for this project even if you are taking MTH301A in the 2021-22 II semester.

* **Intended Audience :** Only UG students. Though anyone fulfilling the prerequisites may request to register, the project will mainly be of interest to Y20 MTH and PHY UGs. Y21s should not apply unless they have sufficient (and provable) mathematical background.
* **Expected Duration :** 4-5 months  
* **Expected Weekly Commitment :** At least 12 hours per week (involves significant self study and exercises).
